    ::: useless
      * SEIZE interesting IDEA and artifacts UI
      * totally NOT:WF-oriented -- beautiful but useless
        e.g. Brain-like graph-overview is unusable even for exploration
          << there is no question which is answered by clunky Brain graph
            (beside "looking beautiful")
          << clustering and distance in this "brain" has no useful meaning,
            when using it as map for exploration
        ! query-like language and tables are much more usable for daily Qs
