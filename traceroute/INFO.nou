Resolve unknown ip
  $ curl ipinfo.io/23.66.166.151

  OR: offline db (therefore out-of-date)

    $ geoiplookup example.com

Resolve whole path
  $ mtr example.com
  $ mtr -n -c1 --report example.com | tee >/dev/tty | awk '$2~/^[0-9.]+$/{print$2}' | xargs -rL1 -I{} curl ipinfo.io/{}


Geolocation by IP
  https://www.iplocation.net/
    * gather different geo coords from diff services to demark the region
    * find your actual coords from google map
    * estimate distance between you and each node based on average traceroute time
      = take into account delays in each node on re-transmission, scheduling of processes and only then -- on cabel length
      = also, each router/switch in chain has its own delays
      = some links are optics = completely different propagation time
    * estimate estimation error and its intersection with geoip region
  TRY: traceroute back to double-check estimations
