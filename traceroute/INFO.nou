Geolocation by IP
  https://www.iplocation.net/
    * gather different geo coords from diff services to demark the region
    * find your actual coords from google map
    * estimate distance between you and each node based on average traceroute time
      = take into account delays in each node on re-transmission, scheduling of processes and only then -- on cabel length
      = also, each router/switch in chain has its own delays
      = some links are optics = completely different propagation time
    * estimate estimation error and its intersection with geoip region
  TRY: traceroute back to double-check estimations

    = impossible? USE VPN to get better starting point for packages route
  ```
    otherwise you're just talking about any-old encapsulation/VPN/tunneling protocol
    well, yeah, because (barring something like L2TP) you don't encapsulate L2 into L3 ...
    VPLSes.. but probably beyond the scope of the OP's Q
    and I guess that's technically tagging it, not l3 encap. even though it's moved along via an L3 network
  ```
