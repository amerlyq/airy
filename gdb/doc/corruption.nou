Debugging strategy for stack protection is possible and sometimes useful:

    (1) execute the binary compiled with stack protection (-fstack-protector) and disable ASLR (address space layout randomization) in a debugger.
    (2) wait for a core.
    (3) the core will indicate the address of the stack canary that got clobbered.
    (4) re-run your binary in the debugger and set a hardware watch point on the address of the clobbered stack canary.
    (5) the debugger will stop when the memory located at culprit address is modified.
