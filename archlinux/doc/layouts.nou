  * keep mbr/gpt under lvm for /boot and /boot/efi

  * use subvolume per /home/user for separate independent timemachines


ALT: layouts
  ~ per each partition use single btrfs root subvol=/
    BAD: If your "/" is also the top level of your filesystem, then you can't atomically roll back to an earlier snapshot

  ~ single partition with subvolumes :: root ++ home ++ work subvolumes
  ~ two partitions (system|data) :: root ++ home :: media ++ work

SubLayout for each subvolume
  * toplevel -- only contains main dirs (tracked by 'snapper') :: /root, /home, /work, /media
  * main dirs -- contain mandatory subvolumes /@ and /@snapshots
    └─root
      ├─@           | mount /root/@ /mnt
      ├─@snapshots  | mount /root/@snapshots /mnt/.snapshots
      ├─@var_pkg    | mount /root/@pkg_cache /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg
      └─@...        | other excluded+mounted subvolumes (specific for this mountpoint)
  * /@ -- completely flat w/o any subvolumes inside
    => otherwise on restore you must clone+delete each of nested subvolumes one by one
      http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg54931.html
    OR: stick to default way of "Snapper" -- never replace /root and directly boot into snapshot
      BAD:(incongruent): /root itself can't be deleted -- as it has nested subvolume /root/.snapshots
        => /root subvolume becomes abandoned after first restoration of system
        => on other hand you will clearly see that system was restored

      2017-08-12 [X] /.snapshots may actually be movable as whole -- only its subvolumes are "ro-" but not itself
        => may actually be true, but requires excessive manual actions (which can be done by /etc/fstab)
      2017-08-12 [X] /.snapshots is dir or subvolume itself ? ::: subvolume (because it's mountable)
      2017-08-12 [X] /.snapshots on rollback moved or not ? ::: not moved -- "rw-" created directly besides "ro-"
        => so set-default boots into "rw-", mounting snapshots from old location into /.snapshots/7/snapshot/.snapshots
  * snapshots -- moved outside of /@, otherwise you can't:
    => ... replace /@ by "ro-" snapshot from inside it
    => ... delete /@ at all -- having nested /.snapshots subvolume


Exclude from snapshotting by creating subvolumes
  + /vm -- nodatacow -- use VBox built-in snapshotting instead of btrfs one
  + /var/log -- big ~4GB, binary *.journal -- always keep logs as-is for troubleshooting
    [_] CHECK: problems with systemd journaling when unmounting on shutdown
    USE: ext4/nodatacow -- as random writes will slow-down the whole system
  + /var/cache/pacman/pkg -- no sense to snapshot -- big and stale file list
  + /tmp -- exlude in case of large files written to /tmp may become snapshotted
    [_] CHECK: use RAM-exclusive /tmp if possible ?
      BAD: low RAM when building firmware -- need disk-backed /tmp
  - /chroot -- snapshot /chroot together with /root for tight versioning
  - /var -- sep dir only to be able to remount /usr in "ro-"
    => inseparable as whole == contains multiple files tightly synced with /usr
    ! can't be unmounted on shutdown due to systemd journaling to /var/log
  - /var/abs -- restorable db, no need to snapshot (don't exist anymore together with |abs| package)
  ~ /opt -- only if you want to keep corporate software unaffected on rollback
