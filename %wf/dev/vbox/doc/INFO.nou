  Allow Host Window Manager pass through keyboard (e.g. change workspaces)
    You can uncheck "Auto capture keyboard" at bottom in File -> Preferences -> Input.
    : This disables the automatic keyboard grabbing completely, so window
    : manager keybindings are passed directly to it.  Then 'host' key has
    : the opposite effect - it enables grabbing instead of disabling it.

### FIXES WHEN BROKEN ###

When you upgrade kernel, VBoxGuestAdditions will crash
  cd /media/`whoami`/VBOX*
  sudo ./uninstall.run
   #> This gave some messages that indicated that it was uninstalling dkms
     entries and some other things
  sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
  : ~~ One curious thing was that the original folder in /opt showed the
  : previous version of the Guest Additions even though I had been using the
  : .iso for the current version for some time. Not sure if this is a bug,
  : or just that the Guest Additions need to be manually removed each and
  : the new version installed each time there is an upgrade.


Unmount VBoxGuestAdditions
  Could not mount the media/drive
    'C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso'
    (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED).
  Then unmount from nero/pcmanfm before new mount!
