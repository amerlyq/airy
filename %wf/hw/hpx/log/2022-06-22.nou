        ::: OFF: no mode by design
          ¦ The S3 deep sleep mode is not available on the XPS 13 9310. This is by design.
          ¦ dell chose to not include deep sleep in this computer's firmware.

        ¦ "XPS 9310 only offers Modern Standby for Windows and Suspend to Idle for Linux."
        ¦ This means deep sleep is not supported by the firmware on this machine.

        - Microsoft introduced "modern suspend/s0ix/s2idle" in a way that breaks backward compatibility with "classic" S3-sleep
        - Intel added "modern suspend"-support to the linux kernel, but only for their own hardware
        - HP uses modern suspend, thereby choosing to lose S3 support, and thus all support for all OSes that are not windows 10.
