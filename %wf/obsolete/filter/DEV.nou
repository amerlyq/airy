  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2564634/convert-absolute-path-into-relative-path-given-a-current-directory-using-bash
    DFL: use $PWD as base dir
    ~ (-a) make all paths relative to base dir unconditionally
      BUT:BAD: makes unrelated paths longer
    ~ relocate only if possible (makes shorter == path starts with base)
      support multiple bases as args => for each respective matching path
    * reverse operation == make full paths
      add $PWD or list of respective base dirs $ ... [ -b /match/base_dir .. ]
    * derive minimally possible common base path before stripping
      BAD: wait until full list available
    * relocate to concrete symlink
      - readlink it and replace whole beginning if match
      - ALSO: strip current base dir -- if requested

  !4 [_] filter: path-cleanup
    * DFL: strip any single matching path prefix
    * (-r) strip all prf recursively per each path
    * (empty) strip $PWD
    ? (-l) strip prf as-is and any form of readlink path for symlinks
    ? (-/) strip only './' prefix
    USAGE: $ ... | $0 [<path_prf>..]
      ./current_dir/path/file => path/file
