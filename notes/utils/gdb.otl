	Show registers
		info registers
		 prints out the contents of every register, including all the segment
		 registers. This is often too much information. The "print" command is much
		 more useful.
		print/d $ecx
		print/x $ecx
		print/t $ecx
		 print out the ECX register in decimal, hexadecimal, and binary



 Memory contents can be examined using the "x" command. The "x" command is
 optionally followed by a "/", a count field, a format field, a size field and
 finally a memory address. The count field is a number in decimal. The format
 field is a single letter with 'd' for decimal, 'x' for hexadecimal, 't' for
 binary and 'c' for ASCII. The size field is also a single letter with 'b' for
 byte, 'h' for 16-bit word (half word) and 'w' for a 32-bit word. For example,
 if your program has a label "msg", the following commands:
	x/12cb &msg x/12db &msg x/12xh &msg x/12xw &msg
 will print out respectively the contents of memory starting at msg in the
 following manner: the next 12 bytes as ASCII characters, the next 12 bytes as
 decimal numbers, the next 12 16-bit words in hex, and the next 12 32-bit words
 in hex.

Sometimes, as you are tracing your program, you are really interested in the contents of a specific register. If you issue the command:
	Display
	| info display | will list all the active displays.
	| undisplay	   | to remove an item on this list
	| set disassemble-next-line on  |
		or for older then gdb 7.0 use
	| disp/i $pc   | use to see the asm codes on each '<CR>' command
		: where /i is the format, you can remember it best by thinking
		: "instruction" and $pc being the instruction pointer, also known as
		: program counter
	| display $eax
	| display/i $eip
	 A very good use of the display command is to have the next instruction of
	 the program printed whenever the program is halted.

Also good to know
 Sometimes when stepping through assembly the regs and asm views will get
 borked. Simply execute the respective layout commands again to restore them
 to their old glory:
	(gdb) layout asm
	(gdb) layout regs

Detect tracing in Linux and how to struggle
	http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1930/detecting-tracing-in-linux
	Struggle:
	clear call to ptrace with NOP
		(gdb) set write
		(gdb) set {unsigned int}$pc = 0x90909090
		(gdb) set {unsigned char}($pc+4) = 0x90
		(gdb) set write off
		x/10i $pc
	Alternative:
		Manipulate the program counter (instruction pointer) instead:
			set $pc+=5 or the more explicit set $pc=$pc+5
			jump *$pc+5

	  over and over again -- so move all your code in cycle.

Examining stack frames

If you're stopped at a breakpoint or at an error, you may also want to examine
the state of stack frames further back in the calling sequence. You can use
the up and down commands for this.

### Stack ###
	info locals      print automatic variables in frame
	info args         print function parameters
| bt    | stack backtrace
| frame | show current execution position
| up    | move up stack trace (from func to its caller -- till main)
 (gdb) up
 #1  0x08048441 in main (argc=2, argv=0xffd9add4) at reassemble.c:28
 28        buggy_function ();
| down  | move down stack trace (from func to its callee -- away from main)
 (gdb) down
 #0  0x080483f1 in buggy_function () at reassemble.c:20
 20        int len = strlen (s);

The commands above are really helpful if you're stuck at a segfault and want
to know the arguments and local vars of the faulting function's caller (or
that function's caller, etc.)


Reverse execution (often not available)
TODO: find where available

reverse-continue [ignore-count]
rc [ignore-count]
	Beginning at the point where your program last stopped, start executing in
	reverse. Reverse execution will stop for breakpoints and synchronous
	exceptions (signals), just like normal execution. Behavior of asynchronous
	signals depends on the target environment.
reverse-step [count]
	Run the program backward until control reaches the start of a different
	source line; then stop it, and return control to GDB.
	Like the step command, reverse-step will only stop at the beginning of a
	source line. It “un-executes” the previously executed source line. If the
	previous source line included calls to debuggable functions, reverse-step
	will step (backward) into the called function, stopping at the beginning
	of the last statement in the called function (typically a return
	statement).
	Also, as with the step command, if non-debuggable functions are called,
	reverse-step will run thru them backward without stopping.
reverse-stepi [count]
	Reverse-execute one machine instruction. Note that the instruction to be
	reverse-executed is not the one pointed to by the program counter, but the
	instruction executed prior to that one. For instance, if the last
	instruction was a jump, reverse-stepi will take you back from the
	destination of the jump to the jump instruction itself.
reverse-next [count]
	Run backward to the beginning of the previous line executed in the current
	(innermost) stack frame. If the line contains function calls, they will be
	“un-executed” without stopping. Starting from the first line of a
	function, reverse-next will take you back to the caller of that function,
	before the function was called, just as the normal next command would take
	you from the last line of a function back to its return to its caller 5.
reverse-nexti [count]
	Like nexti, reverse-nexti executes a single instruction in reverse, except
	that called functions are “un-executed” atomically. That is, if the
	previously executed instruction was a return from another function,
	reverse-nexti will continue to execute in reverse until the call to that
	function (from the current stack frame) is reached.
reverse-finish
	Just as the finish command takes you to the point where the current
	function returns, reverse-finish takes you to the point where it was
	called. Instead of ending up at the end of the current function
	invocation, you end up at the beginning.

Basically you can query the registers by prepending a dollar sign, e.g.
	print $ecx
or use them in expressions:
	print $esi + $ebx + 4
You can dereference the memory using the * operator (like in C):
	print *$ecx
will print the contents of the memory location pointed to by ecx.
While you can't directly type in assembly code, you can translate the expression into something more high-level, like this:
	print $eax - ($esi * $ebx)
Also, you can convert to various types using casts to C data-types, e.g.
	print (char)$ecx
would print the contents of ecx as a character.
	print *(char**)$ecx
which would interpret ecx as a pointer to char*, which you then dereference. So you'd see the contents of the string at the address contained in ecx.
This is just the tip of the iceberg though. gdb is very powerful tool. You might also find the display command useful. It's basically the same as print, except it will repeat the print command whenever the code is stopped (useful with breakpoints). You can examine most registers using info registers, or info all-registers if you're masochistic.
You can also change the contents of registers, using set:
	set $eax = 20
