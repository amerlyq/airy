String concatenation (by ++ has O(n) and 8x memory)
	Of course there is one! You should use binary and IoList whenever
	possible. An IoList is iolist = [char() | binary() | iolist()]. They are
	“deep-list”.

	Want to append an IoList a to an IoList b? Simple! Just create a new list
	with 2 elements: a and b! Concatenation has become an O(1) operation. Most
	IO apis accept IoLists.
