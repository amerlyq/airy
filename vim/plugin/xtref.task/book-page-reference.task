We need ability to refer any book page in any format / media

  We could insert xtrefs BUT they are impossible to embed into media itself, no ?
    ~~ TRY: some book formats allow it ~~

  Generic format -- referring by page number, which we could jump
    i.e. /path/to/book:[p]275.2[:5] -- page 275, line offset 20% from top, center of line
