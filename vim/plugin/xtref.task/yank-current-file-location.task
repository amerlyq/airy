IDEA: partially combine with my <[Frame]gy> -- to directly generate snippets
  * combine with new .nou format for indented embedded code
    -- to highlight (OR: dim) at least monotonically .nou inside .nou with different indents
  * reuse feature of "insert with indent" by <count>, permanently stored between paste to buffer var (OR tempfile)

  ./relpath/to/file:11:22  ⌇⡞⡙⢃⢐
    call func()
