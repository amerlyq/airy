# vim:ft=cfg
# FIXED: Sticky Control <-> Caps
keymaps 0-255

# man keymaps
# USE: vt$ showkey  # to find out codes
#        $ sudo showkey -s
# SEE: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-14.html
# [_] Swap Caps<->LCtrl and  LWin<->LAlt in console
# : Affects whole system -- so no need in xkb swapping afterwards

## Copy Control => Caps_Lock
# https://blog.chendry.org/2015/01/11/linux-virtual-console-caps-lock-as-control.html
#   vt$ dumpkeys -l
# keycode 29 = Caps_Lock
## BUG: Caps_Lock don't work as control
#   MAYBE => keyboard hardware doesn't support simultaneous press of Caps and other half of keys
keycode 58 = Control

# keycode 56 = Windows
keycode 56 = Escape
keycode 125 = Alt

# Lang switch? But need ru_win.map as base.
# keycode 100 = AltGr
