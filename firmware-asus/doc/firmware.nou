    [   36.941004] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Could not resolve symbol [\_GPE._L69.D1F0], AE_NOT_FOUND (20190509/psargs-330)

      I have also tons of ACPI errors on my system (ASUSTeK P8Z68-V LX) and I
      can cold boot, but can't do a warm boot after wakeup. Weeks ago it was
      working, but with last updates it is no longer warm booting. â€“ Uwe Disch Apr 13 at 15:33

      NOTE: The package intel-microcode used to be called intel-ucode once. You
      should be running at least kernel version 4.18.0 (cat /proc/version*) because
      that included a fix that allows kernel to try to proceed even with errors
      while loading ACPI tables. Older kernel versions will stop loading the whole
      table in case of any error. And note that if older kernel version does not
      emit errors, it does not mean that it did work correctly - it probably just
      didn't even try to load those tables.
