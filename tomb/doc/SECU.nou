    ::: SECU! by default, modern cryptsetup uses XTS encryption mode which is quite insecure.

    ¦     ??? 2^20*4KiB = 4GiB is recommended max size for crypto containers
    ::: FAIL: server-side versioning / dedupl / backups will create multiple copies of your container i.e. whole-internet @EvilMaid attack
      SECU: using typical plaintexts of filesystem metadata you can XOR key out of these versioned containers
