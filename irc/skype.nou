Bitlbee (server), Weechat (client), setup for chatting with Skype and Google Hangouts (Gtalk)

#weechat   #skype4py   #bitlbee   #gtalk

I have to say it was pretty frustrating getting Skype to work with the Skype4py plugin. GTalk was super easy

Download the latest bitlbee source and run the following command

# Compile and install bitlbee for Skype and openssl use
./configure --skype=1 --debug=1 --ssl=openssl
make
sudo make install

# Create a little startup script for bitlbee service to run
nano bitlbee.sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/bitlbee -c /etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf
(save and exit)

# Download Skype4Py separately and run the following commands
cd skype4py
sudo python setup.py install
mkdir ~/.skyped/
cp /usr/local/etc/skyped/skyped.conf /usr/local/etc/skyped/skyped.cnf .
echo -n <yourskypepass> | sha1sum
# Take the result that comes out here and copy the DIGITS ONLY, don't copy the spaces and the hyphen that are after the sum
nano skyped.conf
# paste in your sum next to password =
# set the username field to your skype username
# set the key and cert paths equal to your home directory and full file path to the certs we are about to create /home/<username>/.skyped/
# exit and save

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -config skyped.cnf -out skyped.cert.pem -keyout skyped.key.pem

# Start Bitlbee, Skyped, and weechat
1.) bitlbee.sh
2.) skyped -n -d
3.) weechat

# Connect weechat to bitlbee
1.) /connect localhost
2.) CTRL+P (to switch windows...this should be documented better)

# Proceed with adding accounts now
# GTalk:
1.) account add jabber <email> <pass>
2.) account jabber on

# Skype:
1.) account add skype <username> <pass>
2.) account skype on

After that all should be working correctly now.

# Errors I received
1.) `Username and/or password is WRONG`. I believe initially that was due to the fact that I compiled bitlbee with --ssl=nss and I used openssl to generate my certificates.
OR it could have been the fact that I built and installed skype4py after making bitlbee
OR it could be simply on initial setup of skype in bitlbee I didn't run a `save` command after adding the account, and bitlbee for some reason needed to only read skypes credentials based off of the configuration file, which is stored in /var/lib/bitlbee/<username>.xml.

I wasn't sure really how to determine what bitlbee was looking at for the username and pass for skype so I modified the following source code file
<bitlbee-3.4/protocols/skype/skyped.py>

line = options.conn.recv(1024)
if line.startswith("USERNAME") and line.split(' ')[1].strip() == options.config.username:
        ret += 1
line = options.conn.recv(1024)
if line.startswith("PASSWORD") and hashlib.sha1(line.split(' ')[1].strip()).hexdigest() == options.config.password:
        ret += 1
dprint("Username=" + options.config.username)
dprint("Password=" + options.config.password)
# I added the two dprint lines just to make sure my username and password were pulling from the correct directory </home/<username>/.skyped/skyped.conf> file. After re-compiling the source code I was able to see the username and pass print out in the terminal that was running skyped -n -d. ï»¿
