TODO
  [_] DEV: sync "notes" repo content (and only content) to android -- to edit notes on the go
    => when file conflicts simply place both versions near each other and sync them back to later solve conflict on PC
    BET? directly use git on android and forward port for syncthing
  [_] MAYBE: use vps as intermediate node to sync only notes in "@"
    BUT: must enable WAN discovery -- phone can't safely forward ports through SSH without its own access keys
