Reconnect w/o password until at least one session is alive

Control Sockets
  To be able send many request w/o retype password to SSH
  You can do this cleanly with an ssh 'control socket'. To talk to an
  already-running SSH process and get it's pid, kill it etc. Use the 'control
  socket' (-M for master and -S for socket) as follows:
    $ ssh -M -S my-ctrl-socket -fnNT -L 50000:localhost:3306 jm@sampledomain.com
    $ ssh -S my-ctrl-socket -O check jm@sampledomain.com
  Master running (pid=3517)
    $ ssh -S my-ctrl-socket -O exit jm@sampledomain.com
  Exit request sent.
  Note that my-ctrl-socket will be an actual file that is created.


Allow password access
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ...
    # ATT: at the end of file ('Match' affects all lines till end of file)
    Match address 192.168.1.0/24
      PasswordAuthentication yes
  $ sudo service ssh restart


Enter â†µ, ~, ?:
  Supported escape sequences:
  | ~. | terminate session
  | ~B | send a BREAK to the remote system
  | ~R | Request rekey (SSH protocol 2 only)
  | ~# | list forwarded connections
  | ~? | this message
  | ~~ | send the escape character by typing it twice
  (Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)
