Control Sockets
  To be able send many request w/o retype password to SSH
  You can do this cleanly with an ssh 'control socket'. To talk to an
  already-running SSH process and get it's pid, kill it etc. Use the 'control
  socket' (-M for master and -S for socket) as follows:
    $ ssh -M -S my-ctrl-socket -fnNT -L 50000:localhost:3306 jm@sampledomain.com
    $ ssh -S my-ctrl-socket -O check jm@sampledomain.com
  Master running (pid=3517)
    $ ssh -S my-ctrl-socket -O exit jm@sampledomain.com
  Exit request sent.
  Note that my-ctrl-socket will be an actual file that is created.


Allow password access
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ...
    # ATT: at the end of file ('Match' affects all lines till end of file)
    Match address 192.168.1.0/24
      PasswordAuthentication yes
  $ sudo service ssh restart


Connect headless SSH
# THINK:MOVE: in ./airy/README.md?
  $ ssh bsrv 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  $ scp /usr/share/terminfo/s/st-256color bsrv:/tmp
  $ scp /usr/share/terminfo/t/tmux-256color bsrv:/tmp
  $ ssh -t bsrv 'for f in st-256color tmux-256color; do sudo mv -v "/tmp/$f" "/usr/share/terminfo/${f:0:1}/$f"; done'
  Disable ubuntu welcome garbage on ssh login
    sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
  Relogin: after 'chsh' to ZSH (kill shared connection)
  $ ssh -O exit bsrv
  = $ sudo ln -svf /bin/bash /bin/sh
  = $ v /etc/host
  = $ ./cfg/dev/chroot/prf/ubuntu-15.10


Enter â†µ, ~, ?:
  Supported escape sequences:
  | ~. | terminate session
  | ~B | send a BREAK to the remote system
  | ~R | Request rekey (SSH protocol 2 only)
  | ~# | list forwarded connections
  | ~? | this message
  | ~~ | send the escape character by typing it twice
  (Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)
