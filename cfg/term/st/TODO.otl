		Use fzf instead dmenu?

		:> It's not, it was bug, closed at 2015-12-20
	2015-12-26 [X] gpg not launched? another order of zsh configs?
		:? Maybe some configs not executed due to errors by 'st' terminfo?

	[_] vim
		2015-12-22 [X] vim colors -- for my notches -- no guifg color in scheme
		2015-12-23 [X] when vim lose focus by i3+Enter -- black screen. No redraw?
			:= Resembles redraw and Focus events (but not auto-relnum?)
			:= Seems like problem contained in core-cfg/{ui-colors,ui}.vim
			:= Problem persistent only for nvim. But not by colorscheme.
			:> lazyredraw -- BUG? interference with nvim window resizing? REQ?
		[_] vim autonumber on FocusGained -- double blink -- excess event in plugin?
			:> BUG:TODO:REQ: write bugreport to suckless mail list. Or patch?
			:= FocusGained/Lost events are sent twice -- it's not cfg/ or plugin/
			:= Seems like it's 'st' itself, as nvim and vim are equally blinks
			:= Not my patches.
			:> CHECK: maybe it's problem related to i3 (like auto-options)?
		2015-12-23 [X] Broken general vim colorscheme in st, nvim works as expected
