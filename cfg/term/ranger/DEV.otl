[X] press_enter(),
	Change std ranger msg core/runner.py:39 to some terminal variable
	It's to distinguish several outputs easily
[X] Context
	Popen, popen_kws, action
		< Need use 'executable' arg
			https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen

[_] Autocompletion on <Tab> in ':' line
	: Ability was added in plugin functional
	: but how to add zsh completion there?

[X] # 1
	I use zsh with extended globbing, etc, and miss it in ranger.
	Spawning subshell for one command a time is too slow, comparing to ':'.

[X] # 1.5
	I missed the legion of aliases, spawned in zsh.

[_] # 2
	%%s with "..."  around each file. When escaping isn't enough.
	fix '%d/%f' problem with '' and spaces in name

[X] # 3
	I never liked the idea of trailing whitespaces in config file.
	My plugin to vim always discards them on saving.
	Additional ' ' after command will not make any harm, even if that command don't need it.
	But you could suppress it by -p0 flag when really-really need such behaviour.
	So I changed default behaviour to this in sake of consistency with other conf files.

[$] # 3.5
	Preview of terminal under ranger toggle by one key
		mapped to ,z
	But are you need to keep ability scrolling, etc in this preview?
		Scroll by urxvt embedded instruments
	Of course yes! How it's done in ranger now?

[_] # 4
	Multiwindow support. To be able split ranger on two window and make diffs easily
		ALT (or in addition): shared copy/cut buffers between picked ranger
		sessions -- to open several rangers and cross-moving files in them

[_] # 5
	Reset tab number to 1, when there only one tab last.
	Or shift every tabs numbers to fill gap in sequence.
	= Impossible -- cause you must be able to undo tab closing!

[$] # 6
	find on 'f' -- be able to stick to only dir or only files names
		Simply combine 'filter_inode' and 'find'

[_] # 7 Prompt --
	For long output (like agi) prompt is more suitable in bottom place.
	\\=== Press ENTER to continue === (13:53:41) === agi 'some\(' ===>>
	Last part of this prompt could be written as in actualee script
	[_] Customizable with embedded macro -- great in conjunction with creating
			custom macro like date, time, etc
	Make hooks pre- and post- command execution. Link post- with default prompt.
	[_] Must output error code of last command

[X] # 8
	Distinguish action "right" as Editor, and 'L', 'C-j', <CR> as viewers
	But!!! Complete some end-product before!

[$] # 9
	For new feature on 'b' -- and ticket for ':filter' -- when hiding dirs
	and enables 'b' -- there must be only dirs shown! Now it will show nothing.
		Already done -- all works

Completely detach ranger interface from filemanager
: You can use frontend with navigation for all tasks which involve lists of entries!
	[_] Show all found files inside browser
		[_] add function to show find results
			: Ranger already can show all files under dir on 'b'
	[_] Show any other results -- like from 'ag' -- list of entries
		Each entry can be opened like any other file, but at specified line/column!
	[_] Show history of previous commands
	[_] Errors of make

[_] actualee
	[X] empty -- dump all, sorted by current first, then others
	[_] don't execute if has no 'x' in permissions
	[_] selection -- dump to list all selected files
	[_] argument -- treat as regex. Filename will match themselves.

[_] Show copying speed around percents on Task view

DEV
	[_] Ipc with interactive zsh instance in separate thread.
		:= Seems like it will need headless terminal emulator written in python?
		:= Sockets are better: http://www.theochem.uni-duisburg.de/cgi-bin/info2www?(zsh)The+zsh/net/socket+Module
		:http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2007/msg00785.html
		:SEE: tmux-vim async integration -- how vim launches commands inside separate panel
		Faster -- as it loads once and always works
		Relaunching when it crashes
		All aliases and abilities can be available from ranger's ':'
		SEE maybe you even be able to create terminal and attach that
			background zsh to it? However, scrollback will not be restored?

	[_] Being at '/', left panel is empty -- but you can use it for network/bookmarks!
		Also, using that panel -- you must not do it central, simply move focus and control to left
		Such behaviour may be possible for any path! Being anywhere open list on left and choose!
