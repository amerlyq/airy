	[_] CHG <Space> to operator mode: (vim-osmos?)
	:SEE https://github.com/spiiph/vim-space
		: Add v:count to <Space> insert operator -- amount of chars before exit.
		' A' -- inserts space at line end, then goes to insert regime
		' I' -- inserts space at line beg, then goes to insert regime
		' r' -- inserts space, then replace
		'  ' -- put space
		: Add v:count to <Space> paste operator -- amount of spaces before it
		' p' -- put (yanked) text with space before it
		: THINK choose what to insert -- space or inputted character?
		:	= Do like surround' chains of textobjects?
		:	=> Then <Space>p is shortcut for <Space>i<Space>p
		: v:count treated as amount of spaces inserted
		:= But then I will need some other operator for single-char inserts --
		: to work with other characters beside spaces.
		: USE CamelMotion on Space? Or smart-word for urls-like strings?
		Reuse 'q<Space>' for directly surround by spaces
		DEV:THINK:XXX: use insert as chaining operator:
			Press operator
			Choose what symbol to insert
			Then _any_ motion/textobj (if ending in INSERT else append a/i)
			Return to NORMAL
		[_] FIX [Space]-insert mode after ENH stage
		[_] DEV insert single char instead of my Limio

	[_] CHG <Tab> to operator mode
		TAB-q, TAB-l -- toggle qf lists
	[_] FIND: V-Block character column motions like '0' and '$' -- to fast select region

Operators
	>[_] Create vim-textobj-overhaul -- combine and improve all textobj into
	>		one seamless obj map
	[_] Improve 'gC' to copy-comment multiline/block selection
	[_] Create 'g,[oO]' which leave comment untouched as default
	[_] Create ',[oO]' which drops indent -- better use unimpared/etc to insert empty lines
	[_] g[oO] -- leaving insert w/o resetting indent -- like <C-Esc> or jF/fJ
	[_] DEV '[ai]k' -- copy key until ':' -- useful for yaml
	[_] DEV remap back 'g;' and 'g,' -- as them useful to jump between last changes
		:= Smth with <C-..> would be useful -- as analogy to C-o and C-i
		:= I've already lost <Tab> due to [Unite], so I need submode for all this?
	[_] On key sends obj/sel to new buffer in split window in separate named tab
		:= Useful for deffered analysis, focused on of several functions together

	[_] DEV mapping to move in column like '{/}' -- on gG, g{, g}
		for more simple C-v block selecting
		I can make regex which sticks to \< \> and move until this condition works
		Similar to column textobj, but motion instead of region

	[_] DEV :SortLine inside selection/motion (like inside brackets)
		:= Search for operator-* plugins first, or make one myself
		:= Such operator- plugin may consolidate SortBlock as linewise move


	[_] DEV map 'gc<' for shifting whole inline comment w/o left content
				 ' <' to shift only commented text after commentstring
		:= Can shift as always and exchange spaces between old and new pos

Dict
	[_] Splits on right/left -- reuse choosing mechanism from tagbar
	[_] Save previous screens in tagstack -- to jump on g=/g] and <C-T>
	[_] Autoderive -- if all(char(c)<0x7f) [EnRu,EnUk,EnEn] else [RuEn,UkEn,RuRu]
	[_] Set language by dbus on launch by separate shortcuts

Notches

	Disable on filetypes [help, ?tagbar?, etc]

Outline
	DEV
		Amount of '[>:~]{n}' in line prefix -- changes 256 color to more dim
			: In 8 color term all them will have one color
		After $ -- use complete bash syntax until end of line
		SEE multi syntax regions for this -- or include all syntax into region
		SEE ft=cucumber bundle/sideways.vim/examples/example.feature -- maybe as prototype?
		SEE embedded syntax regions highlighting
			: https://github.com/xolox/vim-notes
		[_] Allow mixed block/flow syntax as in yaml -- for one-word branches in graphviz
		Use cycleable '*/[_]/\d./' list markers (cycle for all list -- not for item)
	[o] Vimoutliner
		[_] TODO Remove insert mappings
		2015-06-01 [X] Change mapping to more easily pressed :> use everywhere ',.'
		[_] Disable autoformating on pasting
		[_] Test and compare with vimoutliner
			: https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki

Manipulations
	[_] DEV Table mode editing -- shift columns (when editing lyrics -- you need
			insert empty lines to align)
		= It could be simple map to ,.<Enter>, ,.<BS>, which moves whole
			column and inserts newline
		ALT HACK edit each text in synced split, then combine

		: https://github.com/vimsmartcols/vimsmartcols
	[_] DEV List manipulation (for forestanza?)
		List textobj -- bare and inside block of pairs
			Srrnd: add/remove brackets -- treat whole list as textobj
		Multiline list
		Change list delimiter  ', ' -> '/' -> '|' -> '>' -> ',' -> ' + '
			Space: no/left/right/surr
			Delim: predefined/getchar
		Apply operator to each element -- like surround, append/prepend, etc
		Vertical lists (columns)
		on 'J' join column with delimiter
		on ?? split list in column
		: THINK -- search for yaml -- to flatten/unfold -- I saw smth on gh.
