| urxvt-ext-evolved

<ALL>
	[_] THINK always use 'Y' instead 'S-y' -- then no need to augment XKeysymToString
	[_] Use on_action as main mechanics (setup cfg for new and note in README for old urxvt)
	[_] Move copy/paste xsel block to common -- as it will be used for more than one?


> Clipboard
BUG
	2015-09-11 [X] Open window, do M-c -- copy (none), then M-m paste
		: -> first empty (wrong), then pastes some values from "+ (right).

DEV
	[_] TRY to replace xsel with api group $self->selection*(..., true)
		: OR use it only if no tool specified for copying
	[_] Menu on M-y and M-p -- with status 'y: current, c: command, ...'
		:= useful when there are too many variants for copy-paste.
	[_] Command output:
		: Copy all text in-between two dividers (currently between prompts)
		: Move between such zones with j/k -- show overlay as square border around it
	[_] M-C-y -- copy whole line where cursor is.
		: by regex (to remove PS1 and PS2) -- when have no zsh.
	[_] M-S-v Insert from "* instead of "+
		: OR copy clipboard "* -> "+ to minimally duplicate shortcuts
	[_] Execute:
		<C-c> to save current (bad when empty)
		<C-u><C-k> to clear (lost prev command)
		Copy current line (interact with zsh) then execute and past that line back
	[_] DEV (desktop X, headless server, ssh w/o X, tmux/screen)
		: no X -> termcode copybuffer if <96k else tmp file or in-mem pipe
		: else -> try consequently xsel, xclip, pbcopy -> treat with no X methods.



> Selector
DEV
	[_] For hints use vertical overlay over whole screen on left side (two char width)
	[_] Bind to current visible text (plus some lines around which contain visible parts of links/pathes)
	[_] Open file path in vim/ranger/xsel current/nested/fork/float
	[_] When matching -- gray out whole screen and highlight only urls and paths
		:= use different colors for file/dir/url

THINK
	[_] Toggle on_line_update by shortcut or osc code from lau-serial?
		man says it could spend alot of time on filtering and redrawing...
		possibly dropping some of output
	[_] NEED keep selected cursor position and highlight when re-activate
	[_] FIX long multiline url -- concatenate and refine before launching in browser
	[_] BUG press Return -- when in active mode -- first time has no effect.
