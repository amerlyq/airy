	2015-06-04 [X] Autocopying on focus lost/gain
		: http://artisan.karma-lab.net/creer-plugin-urxvt-sauvegarder-vim-automatiquement
		WARNING when opening new urxvt ($mod+u) vim is not opened yet, so buffer
				will not be copied in @"! You must keep yank shortcuts for such cases.

Features
	[_] BUG: cursor don't change form in insert. Maybe regression after usleep in urxvt/focus-term?
	[_] BUG: returning into vim drops visual selection -- so 'gv' after vnoremap is not enough?
	[_] Check :wa! with dirty new buffer in vim w/o file to save
		: to implement autosaving on FocusOut
	[_] FIXME: erasing changes scenario
		copied in clipboard, pressed $mSd+X, clipboard edited, change focus from vim
