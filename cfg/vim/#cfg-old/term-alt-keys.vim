" DEPRECATED:
" - Too much bugs in caused by every seen implementation
" - Clushes with terminal escape codes, insert mode, etc
" - Use <Alt/Meta> for urxvt/tmux only, not necessary in vim
" - For gvim use <Alt> only for gui-specific mappings

" <C-v> <M-a> and if it produces 'a' then this will help you. If it instead
