Dell E7440, same problem on 14.04: very quick to change brightness using
intel_backlight command, but hardward keys (Fn-Up/Down) pause the computer
briefly.
	sudo intel_backlight
	sudo intel_backlight 40

Thanks to instruction from user Toz
 (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2208278),
	Current kernel boot line:
		cat /proc/cmdline
	Video card(s):
		lspci -k | grep -iA2 VGA
	Known backlight interfaces:
		for interface in /sys/class/backlight/*; do echo -e "\n $interface"; cat $interface/{brightness,max_brightness,actual_brightness}; done
	A listing of your loaded kernel modules:
		lsmod
	Your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file:
		pastebinit /var/log/Xorg.0.log

the fix requires both
	kernel param "acpi_backlight=vendor"
	 My Dell Latitude E5430 only needed the kernel param adding to work correctly.
	and creating the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf file:
	 Adding the xorg.conf file as well may just caused it to oscillate rapidly +/-
	 10% with a permanent on screen KDE brightness bar.
		Section "Device"
				Identifier "card0"
				Driver "intel"
				Option "Backlight" "intel_backlight"
				BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
		EndSection

Change
	cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
	echo 1000 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness

Add to bootloader:
	sudo vim /etc/default/grub
	: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... video.use_native_backlight=1"
	sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
