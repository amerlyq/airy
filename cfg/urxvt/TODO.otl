FOCUS -- EVENTS
	For example a common problem when we're working in the console is to copy text
	on a remote console (ssh vim) and edit the content locally. By this approach
	is feasible by defining a sequence OSC "clipboard" qu'URxvt recover to
	transfer the contents into the CLIPBOARD selection of the local X11 server.
	Something like:
		echo -en "\033]777;CLIPBOARD;ON\077Ceci est mon texte Ã  copier\033]777;CLIPBOARD;OFF\077"
	Besides, the idea is already a little set up in a little-known plugin urxvt, clipboard-osc.

	> http://karma-lab.net/creer-plugin-urxvt-sauvegarder-vim-automatiquement
	: <Change sources to implement>: VIM launch will enable notification of mouse
	: events to the terminal (set mouse = ...). When it will stop, it will
	: turn off this notification

	> But how to do it less harmful?
	: So even bash will not show those sequences and interpret them instead?
	: Maybe, zsh has built-in ability for focus lost? And I will no need to use urxvt?
