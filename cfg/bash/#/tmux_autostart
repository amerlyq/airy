Autostart with systemd

There are some notable advantages to starting a tmux server at startup. Notably, when you start a new tmux session, having the service already running reduces any delays in the startup.

Furthermore, any customization attached to your tmux session will be retained and your tmux session can be made to persist even if you have never logged in, if you have some reason to do that (like a heavily scripted tmux configuration or shared user tmux sessions).

The service below starts tmux for the specified user (i.e. start with tmux@username.service):

/etc/systemd/system/tmux@.service

[Unit]
Description=Start tmux in detached session

[Service]
Type=forking
User=%I
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tmux new-session -s %u -d
ExecStop=/usr/bin/tmux kill-session -t %u

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Tip: You may want to add WorkingDirectory=custom_path to customize working directory.

Alternatively, you can place this file within your systemd/User directory, for example ~/.config/systemd/user/tmux.service. This way the tmux service will start when you log in.
