%%% DEV:(new features)

[_] Right/left docking persistent bar tab/panel ~ 1/8 screen width
  : -- to keep there small mpv  preview when watching amv and doing work
  : -- some status widgets / load graphics
  M-p [LRTB] -- open panel
    : Overlapping (filling whole physical screen width/height) depends on opening order
    := bottom/top panel seems also acceptable -- with video like 27:10
  M-p [lrtbm] -- jump to panel/main, backNforth
  M-S-p [lrtbm] -- jump to panel/main, backNforth
  M-[, M-] -- ignores panels and jumps only to actual screens
  < Overlay monitor controls can be placed in same group M-p
  NEED control screen panel as you would with windows
    : change size by <,>; Rotate/Reflect by /,?
    Always resize ratio between current/main screen
      On main screen -- resize main and _all_ panels proportionally
      On panel -- resize only _this_ panel, eating space from main

[_] Create two sets of desktops: work-related and my own
  DynamicWorkspaceGroups OR IndependentScreens
  EXPL:USE: fictive virtual screen which switches/replaces current one
  THINK: is there real necessity? I can use mixed layout to compose
  all necessary work windows in one wksp and then jump by mark'n'go

[_] Different/additional/simplified keybindings (for spawn/etc)
  when current window is root OR no windows found on this wksp at all
  BUG:FIND: the default key can't pass through xmonad to actual window
  : https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/xmonad/2012-February/012402.html
  : MAYBE:SEE: sources of submapDefault -- there must be key pass-through
  : ALT: http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Layout-BorderResize.html
  : -- somehow it will pass mouse clicks

[_] Make main window boring
  Skip main window(s) in heterogeneous layouts (Tall, TwoPane, IM, ...)
    Jump to main only by M-h (remember last used main win)
    M-j/k cycles through slave windows only OR stopped at top/bot borders
  Multi main wins -- like slaves -- M-j/k cycles only through main wins
  Single main win: M-j/k jumps to top/bot slave win OR cycles to itself like in multi

[_] Push back pulled windows
  # Need to add properties to each window: prev wksp, prev pos
  [_] Pull and push back
    * Marked wnds on keymap
    * Recalled by name through prompt
  [_] Cancel last push
    * Shift w/o focus (~ 'M-C-[0-9]')
    Track history of pushed windows to recall all of them
  [_] Cycle on pull/push for last window
