> Performance:

For me I get a 50% increase in FPS in all games / openGL apps in Ubuntu with Nvidia by doing the following:-
	1. Enable the binary Nvidia driver
	2. enable 'unredirect fullscreen windows' in CCSM (compiz)
		-  Navigate to ccsm -> Composite - Enable unredirect fullscreen windows
		- If using KDE (far far far better desktop) then the option is it desktop effects -> advanced -> disable desktop effects on fullscreen apps.
	3.  disable 'sync to vblank' (openGL settings) with nvidia-settings
	: (this is really important or all games appear laggy)
