  [_] FIXME: graph for current dir only
    $ glg. = glg -- .
    $ gdf. = gdf -- .
    THINK:ALT: use $PWD by default, use glg@ for all

% TODO
  [_] MOVE: multi-thread workers/jobs into sep script in //shell/zsh
  [_] TODO: enhance status to show for all branches (at least pull/push)
  [_] TODO: show unpushed branches
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7773939/show-git-ahead-and-behind-info-for-all-branches-including-remotes
  [_] FIXME: remove currently active branch from showed list
  [_] THINK: replace my jobs by 'parallel' (and extract jobs in separate script)
    OR: try xarg -P 8
    MAYBE:(parallel) will be able to sort output and print as query available?
  [_] TRY git pull --autostash
  [_] ENH: status for submodules
  [_] CHG: split name in two columns aligned on center -- dir | file
  [_] FIX: filter-out colors from branch name instead of using '\t'
    : necessary for short branch names like 'doc' or 'dev'
  [_] filter list
    * status != NONE
    * dirty
    * push only commited
    * pull only fetched
  [_] THINK by default git cmds -- and shell ones with '-c' OR shell by DFL?
    FIND: how to use aliases for each repo (expanding,autocomplete)
  [_] Provide autocomplete for zsh and source it inside

% DEV
  * go through all and do 'git fetch'
    WARNING: fetch+rebase has unrepairable pitfalls
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6284887/whats-the-difference-between-git-fetch-then-git-rebase-and-git-pull-reb
  = as I see status of all branches -- there no need for git-up
  * go find all 'behind w/o ahead' and make merges
    ALT: 'pull --rebase with stash' but w/o internet access
  * search '.freeze' file up in dir tree -- adding dir1/dir2/$rep accordingly
    [_] Sync '.freeze' through private *mod*
