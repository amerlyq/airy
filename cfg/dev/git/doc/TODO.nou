% TODO
  [_] MOVE: multi-thread workers/jobs into sep script in //shell/zsh
  [_] TODO: enhance status to show for all branches (at least pull/push)
  [_] TODO: show unpushed branches
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7773939/show-git-ahead-and-behind-info-for-all-branches-including-remotes
  [_] FIXME: remove currently active branch from showed list
  [_] THINK: replace my jobs by 'parallel' (and extract jobs in separate script)
    OR: try xarg -P 8
    MAYBE:(parallel) will be able to sort output and print as query available?
  [_] TRY git pull --autostash
  [_] ENH: status for submodules
  [_] CHG: split name in two columns aligned on center -- dir | file
  [_] FIX: filter-out colors from branch name instead of using '\t'
    : necessary for short branch names like 'doc' or 'dev'

% DEV
  * go through all and do 'git fetch'
    WARNING: fetch+rebase has unrepairable pitfalls

  = as I see status of all branches -- there no need for git-up
  * go find all 'behind w/o ahead' and make merges
    ALT: 'pull --rebase with stash' but w/o internet access
  * search '.freeze' file up in dir tree -- adding dir1/dir2/$rep accordingly
    [_] Sync '.freeze' through private *mod*
