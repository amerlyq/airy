    [_] BUG: segfault when trying |aur/pico-tts|


PC
  Merlin
    https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/merlin
    = not easy to use, but it is the only engine using state of the art technology like WORLD vocoder and DNN speech models.
  MaryTTS
    http://mary.dfki.de/
    = gives great sounding results, but is quite heavyweight.
  eSpeak
    http://espeak.sourceforge.net/
    = has a good read of context, has a very small footprint, but the voice sounds very robotic
  Mimic
    https://mimic.mycroft.ai/
    https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic1
    = more advanced fork of the flite project,
      but by default, it doesn’t sound as good as eSpeak
      and doesn’t seem to understand context as well either
