INSTRUCTIONS (5 FILES)
Download Odin v3.14.4

Extract the firmware file you just downloaded. You should get 5 files:
AP (System &Recovery)

BL (Bootloader)

CP (Modem / Radio)

CSC_*** (Country / Region / Operator)

HOME_CSC_*** (Country / Region / Operator)

Add each file to its respective field in Odin v3.14.4. Use CSC_*** if you want to do a clean flash or HOME_CSC_*** if you want to keep your apps and data.
Reboot your phone in Download / Odin mode (make sure your device is off) with the following button combo: POWER + VOLUME DOWN + BIXBY
Other options in case first option did not work or isn't possible.

Option 2 VOLUME DOWN + VOLUME UP then USB cable

Option 3 POWER + VOLUME DOWN + VOLUME UP

Option 4 POWER + VOLUME DOWN + HOME BUTTON

Option 5 (Note9) USB cable + VOLUME DOWN + BIXBY

Option 6 (Note10) POWER + VOLUME UP

Once in download mode, connect your phone to the PC, preferably using the original USB cable you got with your phone. Odin should detect your device and a BLUE box will show up with the COM port number. (Be sure, the SAMSUNG-drivers are installed on your PC!)
Do NOT tick any extra boxes. The only options to be ticked are F.Reset Time and Auto-Reboot.
Click the start button, wait for Odin to say 'PASS' in a GREEN box. Once the flash is complete, your phone will reboot, and you can disconnect your phone from the PC.
