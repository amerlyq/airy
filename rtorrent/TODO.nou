Choose files
  rtorrent does allow you to control which file from a torrent to download
  from the 'File list' view. From the main view get there by selecting the
  particular torrent using up/down arrow keys so it is stared, then hit
  right arrow to view details, then down arrow to select 'File list',
  followed by right arrow to allow you to navigate the file list. Once you
  are in the list of files you move up/down with the arrows keys to select
  the file in question. Then hit the space-bar to toggle through the 'file
  priority' options of whether the file is 'hig' (i.e. High priority),'off'
  (i.e. don't download), or blank (i.e.  'normal'). The 'off' setting allows
  you skip the file(s) in questio

Automation (choose file)
  ``` For proper automation you'd probably want to script it in python or
  ruby using some torrent library, but if it's generally more flexible file
  selection that you're after, then you could try utilizing the web
  interfaces that many torrent clients offer.

  As an example using Tixati client and a hypothetical torrent where there's
  hundreds of directories that each have a subdirectory that you don't want
  (let's say it's called "RUS"). So, after enabling web interface from
  Tixati settings, you'd go to localhost:8888, open a javascript console and
  write something like this:
  ```
  Snippet ```js
    var jq = document.createElement('script');
    jq.src = "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js";
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jq);

    $('.xferstable tr:has(td)').each(function(i,td){
      var fname= $('td:eq(1)', td).text();
      $('input', td).prop('checked', fname.match(/\\RUS\\/) == null);
    })
  ```

  > ``` You can visually verify that it selected the files you wanted
    and click Apply, et voil√†. ```
