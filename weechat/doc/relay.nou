    /relay sslcertkey
    /relay add ssl.weechat <port>
    /set relay.network.password ${sec.data.relaypass}

      = use let's encrypt for a trusted certificate
  NOTE: Even if I use a bouncer (ZNC), this is quite useful to enable relay.
    Like this you have access to all IRC client (ZNC) and all weechat remote interface (WeeChat Relay).
    Of course, WeeChat can do both but ZNC is multi-user.

THINK: run weechat in docker at some VPS
