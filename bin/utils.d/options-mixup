# support table of associated comments above/below with keys
# do it for each merged config file -- receive list of file pairs
# merge keys in order specified by first file in list
# merge and enumerate comments for keys with identical vals in same file order
# for different vals print all vals list and enumerate comments, add mark to search conflicts

# Keys for PR:
#     print only difference for key-vals: clean, sort, diff
