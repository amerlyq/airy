-> first: find out the name of the service. for example: tomcat oder tomcat6 Try this:

    sudo update-rc.d tomcat remove

You can use the following tool:

sudo sysv-rc-conf

If this doesn't work, the next will work

1.) find out your current runlevel

runlevel

2.) (re)move the startskript from the runlevel directory /etc/rcX.d (wher X is the number of the current runlevel) Example:

mv /etc/rc5.d/S90tomcat /etc/rc5.d/disable.S90tomcat

The Skript Starts with S and an Number (for example S90tomcat), which mena: S=stratskript for tomcat, Start at position 90.

Simply delete or move that script.

3.) Finaly also remov the stop-Skript (Kill Skript) which lookes like /etc/rcX.d/Kyytomcat where yy is an Number between 0-99 and X is the runlevel, you still know.

mv /etc/rc5.d/K01tomcat /etc/rc5.d/disable.K01tomcat
