BAD: if multiple external hosts connected
  ! can't map on same port
    ? how to connect on same host as SSH_CONNECTION but to different port
      E.G. initiate new socket connection through already existing socket connection
  ! can't decide with which host to sync xsel
    => use SSH_CONNECTION to distinguish hosts

[_] DEV: nc inside remote xsel, socat on host ssh wrapper
  if -i : nc "$host" "$port"  # Send
  if --nodetach : cat file - | nc "$host" "$port"  # Keep connection
  if -o : onetime read from port

[_] DEV:TEST: in host system by $ DISPLAY= r.ssh localhost
  * open single port for both read / write in two instances
  * test if 'nodetach' needed on host side: nc -l .. | xsel --nodetach -i -b
[_] CHECK: maybe 'neovim' won't call 'xsel' at all if no $DISPLAY

[_] DEV:ALSO: aug r.ssh wrapper on host end

[_] MAYBE: ports for push/pull clipboard as ssh_port+1 and +2 if ssh_port > 1024
  << port can be easily extracted from $SSH_CONNECTION
[_] NOTE: pushing clipboard must be only for focused terminal / window (tmux on focus event)
  [_] TEMP: push only on keypress
  [_] BET:ALT: don't push at all -- wait until 'xsel -i' request on remote side
[_] IDEA: send cmdline args for xsel as first msg when establishing connection
  BAD:SECURITY: on wrong flags even 'xsel -h' may overflow system memory
    [_] CHECK: open existing socket in reverse way (as persistent ssh connection after auth)
    ? attacker opened ssh to my machine -- can I reuse his connection to feed some data into his socket as response ?

[_] DEV: chroot connection in same way
  FIND: how to forward ports into schroot
  CHECK: if problem with xsel-in-chroot => can't unmount persists even then
