 you can totally filter HTTPS with a proxy, especially with a local one.
 Either use the option to activate the dump of you keys on disk (a one-liner
 on every browser) and point the proxy to that file, or just break the SSL in
 2 and rely on the proxy for the actual cert check
 That depends on the proxy. Systems that effectively MITM your own network's
 traffic have been around for some years now. All you need for outbound
 connections is to install an additional certificate in your browser so the
 proxy can act a trusted partner for HTTPS.  I don't know whether anyone has
 made such a proxy for use in the kind of situation we're talking about here,
 however.
