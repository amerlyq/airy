      $ cat /proc/diskstats
    - Use compression?
    - Maybe XFS would be best as for init+mount+r/w time?
    - Utilize 100% I/O and CPU on boot
    - Focus on delays -- enable logs and watch
    - 'quiet' to disable printing
    USE perf, oprofile, strace, bootchart

    E4rat
      https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ext4#Tips_and_tricks
       E4rat is a preload application designed for the ext4 filesystem. It
       monitors files opened during boot, optimizes their placement on the
       partition to improve access time, and preloads them at the very
       beginning of the boot process. E4rat does not offer improvements
       with SSDs, whose access time is negligible compared to hard disks.
