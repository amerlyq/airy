  Program logic
    2017-01-09 [X] CHECK: removing 'st' patch for startup lines
      ::: FIXED in mainline
      Requisites:
        * multiple fallback fonts for 'monospace'
        * hi dpi to distinguish different font sizes by eye
      Running on HiDPI with 'pixelsize' -- all works as expected:
        $ st -f monospace:pixelsize=35
      Using relative font size, only first font treats 'size' as relative.
      But all consequent fonts treat that size like it's absolute:
        $ st -f monospace:size=10  # only first font ~= pixelsize=35
        $ st -f monospace:size=35  # only fallbacks ~= pixelsize=35
      However, if after that I use <C-S-Home> -- fonts will be reloaded
      and size for all symbols becomes correct.
