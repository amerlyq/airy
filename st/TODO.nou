NOTE
  Alternative workflow (github + branches) have crumbled
  on backward-incompatible changes -- E.G. splitting file.
    => Currently trying more raw workflow with patch files
  [_] TODO reuse ./install and ./PKGBUILD before deleting repo

  Program logic
    2017-01-09 [X] CHECK: removing 'st' patch for startup lines
      ::: FIXED in mainline
      Requisites:
        * multiple fallback fonts for 'monospace'
        * hi dpi to distinguish different font sizes by eye
      Running on HiDPI with 'pixelsize' -- all works as expected:
        $ st -f monospace:pixelsize=35
      Using relative font size, only first font treats 'size' as relative.
      But all consequent fonts treat that size like it's absolute:
        $ st -f monospace:size=10  # only first font ~= pixelsize=35
        $ st -f monospace:size=35  # only fallbacks ~= pixelsize=35
      However, if after that I use <C-S-Home> -- fonts will be reloaded
      and size for all symbols becomes correct.

vim
  2015-12-22 [X] vim colors -- for my notches -- no guifg color in scheme
  2015-12-23 [X] when vim lose focus by i3+Enter -- black screen. No redraw?
    = Resembles redraw and Focus events (but not auto-relnum?)
    = Seems like problem contained in core-cfg/{ui-colors,ui}.vim
    = Problem persistent only for nvim. But not by colorscheme.
    > lazyredraw -- BUG? interference with nvim window resizing? REQ?
  [_] vim autonumber on FocusGained -- double blink -- excess event in plugin?
    > BUG:TODO:REQ: write bugreport to suckless mail list. Or patch?
    = FocusGained/Lost events are sent twice -- it's not cfg/ or plugin/
    = Seems like it's 'st' itself, as nvim and vim are equally blinks
    = Not my patches.
    > CHECK: maybe it's problem related to i3 (like auto-options)?
  2015-12-23 [X] Broken general vim colorscheme in st, nvim works as expected
