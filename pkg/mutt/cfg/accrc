# BAD: queries password before it will be setup
# TRY: accumulate into variable and then set once after all accounts
# ALT: set mailbox inside hook (BUT how to set it only once? OR mutt itself won't set it again?)
#   => inside acc-load
# CHECK: if =INBOX will expand immeiately in accumulating var, or expand to last acc only on final 'mailboxes $my_mboxes'
# Watch over this dir, add to list on 'y'
mailboxes =INBOX
# mailboxes imaps://imap.gmail.com/INBOX    # Space-delimited list: imaps://imap.gmail.com/family
#>  config includes a macro bound to the 'y' key which will allow you to change
#>  to any of the folders listed under mailboxes
# NOTE: when watching multi-acc mailboxes it may be necessary to impl 'close this mailbox' command to unsubscribe
# TODO: autosort Quora and dev@suckless.org by gmail --> and add them to mailboxes to watch over new mails
#   BUT: then I won't receive those messages on my phone? How to watch new messages even there?

# WARN: folder-hook not run on cmdline sent
folder-hook  "$folder"   "set my_acc=$my_acc my_pass=\$my_pass_$my_acc; source $my_cfg/acc-load"

# CHECK: is it enough to query passwd only on folder-hook
#   -- What about simultaneous watching mailboxes?
account-hook "$folder"   "set imap_user=$imap_user imap_pass=\$my_pass_$my_acc"
account-hook "$smtp_url" "set smtp_url=$smtp_url   smtp_pass=\$my_pass_$my_acc"
