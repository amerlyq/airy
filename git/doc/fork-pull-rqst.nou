    ? git request-pull -p master upstream 123-fix-ini-file
    ? git request-pull refs/remotes/upstream/master $(git config --get remote.origin.url) HEAD
  < You can have different names for local and remote branch
    git push https://git.ko.xz/project master:for-linus
    ? git request-pull v1.0 https://git.ko.xz/project master:for-linus

  Look at the unmerged branches:
    git branch --no-merged
  Look at branches that contain a particular commit (e.g. when cherrypicking):
    git branch --contains 1234abcd

    git request-pull master^^^^^ $(git config remote.origin.url)

After Pull request
   Since you worked on the topic branch instead of the master branch, you can
   continue working while waiting for the pull request to go through.
  Be sure to create the topic branch from master.
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout -b document_blahfasel_setting
    git branch -a
    document_blahfasel_setting
    master
    123-fix-ini-file
  When Your Pull Request is Accepted
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git log
     ( hey there's me! ya! )
   You can now delete your topic branch, because it is now merged into the
   main repository and in the master branch.
    git branch -d 123-fix-ini-file
    git push origin :123-fix-ini-file
   I know, deleting a remote topic branch is ugly
     (git push origin :123-fix-ini-file).
  If Your Pull Request is Rejected
   In this case, you just need to update your branch from the main
   repository and then address the rejection reason.
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout 123-fix-ini-file
    git rebase master
     ( edit / commit / edit / commit)
    git push origin 123-fix-ini-file
Receive pull request
  git checkout master
  git remote add contributor git://github.com/contributor/project
  git fetch contributor
  git merge contributor/newfeature
  git push origin master
