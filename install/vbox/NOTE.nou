The key here, which was not obvious to me, was to select "Host Device" and
enter, seemingly redundantly, "COM1" as the host path. I did NOT select
"Create Pipe".

Better -- to forward simple USB device.  Then connect minicom to ttyUSB0 But
your device will be blocked for host until exit guest.

  minicom -s -c on
  sudo cat /dev/ttyUSB0 | sed "/^E\//d; /\[TUNER\]/d; /SendMsearchResponse/d; /^info:/d; w $HOME/tztv" print "20089999\n97\n98\nls -l\n" | sudo tee /dev/ttyUSB0Â 

< Fixing your virtualbox shared folder symlink error

Operations such as installing node.js or python virtualenv to a virtualbox
writable shared folder can fail if you try to do this as a linux (ubuntu)
virtualbox guest running Windows 7 host.

The cause is symlink permission.

Typical error:

ln -fs out/Release/node node ln: failed to create symbolic link `node':
Read-only file system It can also be a "Protocol error".

This happens even if your shared folder is writable.

< Fix: Enable symlinks feature in VirtualBox

Run at cmd prompt:

VBoxManage setextradata YOURVMNAME
VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/YOURSHAREFOLDERNAME 1 Verify
by running:

VBoxManage getextradata YOURVMNAME enumerate If your user belongs to
Administrators group then start VirtualBox with "Run as Administrator"!

< If user is not in Administrators group

By default Windows 7 security policy does not allow creating symlinks as it's
a potential security threat. Run "secpol.msc" and navigate to "Local
Policies-User Rights Assignments" and add your user to "Create symbolic
links". I didn't try that but could be that after that virtualbox could be run
as a regular user.

Speculation: The controversy is that users with admin group seem to be unable
to create symlinks even after granting the permission unless they use "run as
admin". Maybe symlink privilege gets filtered out for regular runs when user
belongs to Administrators. Any ideas?

Let me know if it helps or if there's an easier way!


Thanks a lot!  Yes, i can confirm that user which account type is
"Administrator" can create symlinks, only when running VB with "run as
administrator". It isn't cozily. I simply created new administrator account
"admin" and changed my user account to "Standart". I did manipulations
described on this post and all works fine. And now If i need to run some
different app as administrator i simply choose "run as administrator" from
dropdown menu and it asks me my "admin" user password. My system is Windows 8.


For me, yes it worked for creating symlinks in shared folders from my Ubuntu
guest OS. But now my init.d/rc.local script doesn't seem to get executed
anymore, so the shared folders are no longer automatically mounted. I don't
know why this change would cause this to happen. It doesn't make any
difference if I start VirtualBox as administrator or not.

Edit: The mount command shows that the folder is indeed being mounted, but for
some reason it isn't accessible unless I manually mount it again. Then the
'mount' command shows two identical entries for the mounted folder.

I'll add that I've been using this VirtualBox and Ubuntu environment, with
that same shared folder, for months without problem. Only after I applied this
fix to be able to create symlinks, did I start experiencing this problem with
folder access.
